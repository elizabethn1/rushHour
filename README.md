This program replicates the game Rush Hour. The objective of the game is to make the 'R' car
be next to the exit by moving cars around the board. To move a car, the user will enter a
three-character sequence, which instructs the car to move (if possible or as much as possible).
Otherwise, the user could quit the game.
